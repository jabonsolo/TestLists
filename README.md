# Content

## [/listversions](https://github.com/jabonsolo/TestLists/tree/master/listversions)
This folder contains a subfolder for each different list and inside them there are different version of the list from a specific date. New version of lists are added depending on my needs to do some tests.

## [/testlists](https://github.com/jabonsolo/TestLists/tree/master/testlists)
This folder contains different lists modified by myself based on EasyList. They contain different cases I want to test.

## [/otherlists](https://github.com/jabonsolo/TestLists/tree/master/otherlists)
Lists inside this folder could be moved to ```/testlists``` as those lists contains a subset of filters from EasyList based on the difference of two EasyList versions.
